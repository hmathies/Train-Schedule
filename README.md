# Train-Scheduler

<h2>Technologies Used: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bootstrap 3: </li><p>I used Bootstrap for most of the project and then added custom CSS when I wanted something unique.</p>
    <li>Firebase: </li><p></p>
    <li>MomentJS: </li><p>used to parse and manipulate time in jQuery in order to tell users the how many minutes away a train is, while updating every second!  Read the documentation <a href="https://momentjs.com/">here.</a></p>
    <li> JQuery: </li><p>for basic site functionality.</p>
  </ul>

<h3>Description: </h3>

<p>This is an application that uses Google's Firebase to host arrival and departure train times.  I chose a serene UI.  To get the hazed background image look, be sure to use the CSS opacity property.  The train background image is set to opacity 0.8.</p>

<p>The MomentJS library is how the app is able to calculate the next train arrival time (based on the current time) as well as calculate the minutes away. </p>
